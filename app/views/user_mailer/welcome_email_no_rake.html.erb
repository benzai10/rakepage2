  <strong>Your Briefings</strong> (<a href=<%= user_url %> >link to your account</a>)
</p>
<p>
  You don't have any briefings yet. A briefing consists of a customizable news feed, an overview of planned tasks and a prorgress-tracker. You can save content from the news feed and your briefing will make sure you don't forget about it. The progress-tracker shows you how consistently you take action towards your goals. Try it for a few days and experience the motivational effect!
